To get started, simply use Blender as you usually would, transforms will be automatically constrained to a plane based on your view angle.

To turn off automatic constraints you can press the ![ac_on](assets/ac_on.png){ width="16" } icon in the top bar. Alternatively you can use the shortcut [Shift + Alt + X]. This can be configured in add-on preferences, see [Hotkeys](hotkeys.md#toggle-constraints)

## Constraint Plane
By default constraints will be applied

## UI cheatsheet
Here is a handy reference sheet of all options in the toolbar
