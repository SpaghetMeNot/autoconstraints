**autoConstraints** is a Blender add-on that reduces the guesswork of working in the 3D viewport by automatically applying axis-constraints to a variety of 3D tools.

- No need to manually apply constraints to every operation
- No switching in and out of orthographic views
- No clicking small parts of gizmos
